### What I Learned:
In this lab I was able to create my own GitHub organization and repository. After creating my repository, I cloned it from GitHub to my local system using Terminal. Next I created a file through terminal initialized it and added it to git, then I experimented with *try..catch..finally, throw* and pushed my local changes to my GitHub repo.
