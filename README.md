### What I Learned:
In this lab I was able to go through a short GitHub course to get familiar with the language and site. After that, I created a digital book libary in VS Code using *class*, *counstructor*, and *this.*. This digital library allowed me to add, delete, and count books and took inputs such as book name, author, date published, and ISBN.
